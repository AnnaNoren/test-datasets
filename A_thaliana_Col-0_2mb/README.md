# Description

This folder contains ONT (10.14) and PacBio HiFi reads from Col-0. 
This subset was created from a whole-genome sequencing, mapping reads to Col-CENv1.2 and extracting reads that mapped to Chr1:5mb-7mb.
ONT-Col-0_flye_assembly.fasta.gz was created by running the test dataset through the test-profile.
