# ![nfcore/test-datasets](docs/images/test-datasets_logo.png)
Test data to be used for automated testing with the nf-core pipelines

## Introduction

nf-core is a collection of high quality Nextflow pipelines. This repository contains various files for CI and unit testing of nf-core pipelines and infrastructure.

The principle for nf-core test data is as small as possible, as large as necessary. Always ask for guidance on the [nf-core slack](https://nf-co.re/join) before adding new test data.

## Documentation

nf-core/test-datasets comes with documentation in the `docs/` directory:

01. [Add a new  test dataset](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/master/docs/ADD_NEW_DATA.md)
02. [Use an existing test dataset](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/master/docs/USE_EXISTING_DATA.md)

## Downloading test data

Due the large number of large files in this repository for each pipeline, we highly recommend cloning only the branches you would use.

```bash
git clone <url> --single-branch --branch <pipeline/modules/branch_name>
```

To subsequently clone other branches[^1]

```bash
git remote set-branches --add origin [remote-branch]
git fetch
```

## nf-core/taxprofiler specific information

The main test data used for nf-core/taxprofiler is from [Maixner et al. (2021) _Curr. Bio._](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.09.031), with ENA project accession ID: PRJEB44507. The following selected libraries were all sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq, and were selected due to their small size (~1million reads, <100MB) and known mixture of (gut) bacteria, (ancient human) eukaryotes, and (yeast) fungi (according to the results of the paper).

- ERX5474937
- ERX5474932
- ERX5474930
- ERX5474936

Data was downloaded with nf-core/fetchNGS 1.5 (with Nextflow 21.10.06):

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/fetchngs --input maixner2021_acc_codes.txt --input_type sra
```

One of the files was converted to FASTA file with seqtk 1.3-r106

```bash
seqtk seq -a  ERX5474930_ERR5766174_1.fastq.gz > ERX5474930_ERR5766174_1.fa.gz 
```
