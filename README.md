# nf-core/genomeassembler testdatasets

This branch contains test data for the pipeline nf-core/genomeassembler.

## Datasets

- Drosophila Melanogaster 2Mb region with insertion: `drosophila_melanogaster_2mb`
- Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) 2Mb region; Chr1:5MB-7MB. ONT and HiFi reads from a single individual: `A_thaliana_Col-0_2mb`. This also includes short read data subset from SRR1604937 to a Chr1:4.5-6.8MB. The shortread data is slightly mismatched to have exclusive regions (kmers) in both the assembly and the short-reads.
