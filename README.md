-->
This branch contains test data to be used for automated testing with the nf-core/scnanoseq pipeline.

## Content of this repository

`reference/`: Sub-sampled genome reference files

<!---
TODO: add more info here under testdata

`testdata/`:

`samplesheet/samplesheet.csv`: samplesheet file for minimal test dataset

`samplesheet/samplesheet_full.csv`: samplesheet file for full test dataset

## Minimal test dataset origin

<!---
TODO: add brief data information (noting that it's >Q20 technology) and citation
-->

### Sampling information

### Sampling procedure

<!---
Not all branches have this but thought it was nice in `rnaseq` https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/rnaseq#sampling-procedure
Think having some of this inforamtion will be helpful

## Full test dataset origin

<!---
TODO: Again, add brief data information (noting that it's >Q20 technology) and citation
-->

<!---
TODO: ensure there is no other relevant info. that should be added
