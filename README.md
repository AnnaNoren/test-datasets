## Downloading test data

Due the large number of large files in this repository for each pipeline, we highly recommend cloning only the branches you would use.

```bash
git clone <url> --single-branch --branch <pipeline/modules/branch_name>
```

To subsequently clone other branches[^1]

```bash
git remote set-branches --add origin [remote-branch]
git fetch
```
