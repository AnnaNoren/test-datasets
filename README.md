# test-datasets: `cutandrun`

Test data to be used for automated testing with the nf-core pipelines

This branch contains test data for the [nf-core/cutandrun](https://github.com/nf-core/cutandrun) pipeline.

## Documentation
nf-core/test-datasets comes with documentation in the `docs/` directory:

01. [Add a new  test dataset](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/master/docs/ADD_NEW_DATA.md)
02. [Use an existing test dataset](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/blob/master/docs/USE_EXISTING_DATA.md)

## GSE145187 dataset origin

The test data available was taken from the original CUT&Tag protocol published in [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0373-x)/[pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32913232/)

The experiment was performed using two antibody targets for the histone marks h3k4me3 and h3k27me3. Each target had two biological replicates with an IgG control for each replicate.

The data can be found at [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145187)
