Test data to be used for automated testing with the nf-core pipelines

## Introduction

nf-core is a collection of high quality Nextflow pipelines. This repository contains various files for CI and unit testing of nf-core pipelines and infrastructure.

The principle for nf-core test data is as small as possible, as large as necessary. Please see the [guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/test_data_guidelines) for more detailed information. Always ask for guidance on the [nf-core slack](https://nf-co.re/join) before adding new test data.

## Downloading test data

Due the large number of large files in this repository for each pipeline, we highly recommend cloning only the branches you would use.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets.git --single-branch --branch references
```
