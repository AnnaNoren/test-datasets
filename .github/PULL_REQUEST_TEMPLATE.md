## PR checklist

Closes #XXX <!-- If this PR fixes an issue, please link it here! -->

- [ ] I read the [test-data specifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/components/test_data)
- [ ] I tried testing my module with available data and there is no compatible data in test-datasets
- [ ] If I added data:  I described the new files on the root `README.md`
- [ ] If I modified data: I checked whether the root `README.md` is still up-to-date
- [ ] I made sure to submit the smallest dataset possible (e.g. try .tar.gz for larger directories)
