This folder stores all test data for the AWS tests run for every release.
They should be full size data sets, that have meaningful results. They still should be manageable and finish in a few hours.
Do *NOT* store the data here on github but put URLs in the samplesheets/SDRF files so they are downloaded from an FTP or a public database.
