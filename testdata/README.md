This folder contains small test data sets for continuous integration. Potentially this can store spectra data as well if it is small enough.

Currently, quantms supports four main workflows and data analysis:

- LFQ workflow: Label-free data analysis workflow
- TMT workflow: TMT data analysis workflow
- DIA workflow: LFQ-DIA data analysis workflow
- LFQ Phospho: Phospho localization data analysis workflow
