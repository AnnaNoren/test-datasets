# Test mkfastq

The file `220422_M11111_0222_000000000-K9H97_mkfastq.tar.gz` was generated by adding the following files and folder to the original `220422_M11111_0222_000000000-K9H97.tar.gz` file:
- `RTAComplete.txt`
- `runParameters.xml`
- The `Config` folder

These additional files and folder were extracted from the `cellranger mkfastq` test tar.gz file provided by 10x Genomics, available [here](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/cellranger-tiny-bcl-1.2.0.tar.gz). The steps involved were:
1. Uncompress the original tar.gz file.
2. Copy the additional files and folder.
3. Recompress the files using `tar -czvf`.

# Test pe (paired end)

The file `YYMMDD_M11111_0222_000000000-K9H97.tar.gz` was generated through the following steps:
1. Convert `220422_M11111_0222_000000000-K9H97_mkfastq.tar.gz` to FASTQ format.
2. Generate a reverse complementary reads file using the `pe_gen.py` script included in this folder.
3. After generating the paired-end FASTQs, use the [fastq2bcl](https://github.com/tucano/fastq2bcl) tool to convert the FASTQ files back to BCL files.
4. Compress the resulting BCL files to generate the final tar.gz file.

The samplesheet for this file was generated by taking the original "SampleSheet.csv" and then duplicating the row under the \[Reads\] section.
