# Datasets for UMI testing

## Illumina TSO

This small dataset includes only reads mapped to chromosome 20. A smaller reference could also be used.
Both reads include UMIs with structure 7M1S+T (i.e. a 7bp UMI followed by a constant base and the template)

## QIAseq reads

From SRA repository, simply selected the first 300,000 reads from SRR7545951: this sample has been used to develop smCounter2.
In this case only read 2 includes a UMI, with structure 12M11S+T.
