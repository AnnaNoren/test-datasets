## Experimental Contrasts

The contrasts defined in [`rnaseq_complex_contrast.yaml`](./rnaseq_complex_contrast.yaml) are used to test and compare different model formulas and contrast strings for RNA-seq differential expression analysis.

Each contrast represents a distinct way of modeling the data, ranging from simple treatment effects to complex interaction terms involving genotype and time.
