This folder holds test datasets for modules (Vireo, Popscle, ScSplit, and Souporcell) that deconvolve single-cell multiplexed datasets. 
The dataset, provided by Popscle (https://github.com/statgen/popscle/), contains genetic data from 2 donors. Cell barcodes for scsplit come from the test data from the [hadge](https://github.com/theislab/hadge) pipeline.
For compatibility and testing within nf-core pipelines, the BAM and VCF files have been downsampled to include only data from chromosome 21.
