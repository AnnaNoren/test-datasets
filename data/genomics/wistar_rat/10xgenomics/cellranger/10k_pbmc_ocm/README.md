# 10k Wistar Rat PBMCs Multiplex Sample

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a Wistar rat strain were obtained by 10x Genomics from iQ Biosciences.

Gene Expression libraries were generated as described in the GEM-X Universal 3' Gene Expression v4 4-plex User Guide (CG000768) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X+ with approximately 40,000 read pairs per cell for the Gene Expression library.

Paired-end, dual indexing:

* 28 cycles Read 1
* 10 cycles i7
* 10 cycles i5
* 90 cycles Read 2
