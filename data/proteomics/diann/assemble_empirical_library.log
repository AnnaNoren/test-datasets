diann --f RD139_Narrow_UPS1_0_1fmol_inj1.mzML --lib lib.predicted.speclib --threads 2 --out-lib empirical_library --temp ./quant/ --verbose 3 --rt-profiling --use-quant --gen-spec-lib --individual-mass-acc --individual-windows 

Thread number set to 2
The spectral library (if generated) will retain the original spectra but will include empirically-aligned RTs
Existing .quant files will be used
A spectral library will be generated
Mass accuracy will be determined separately for different runs
Scan windows will be inferred separately for different runs
DIA-NN will optimise the mass accuracy separately for each run in the experiment. This is useful primarily for quick initial analyses, when it is not yet known which mass accuracy setting works best for a particular acquisition scheme.
